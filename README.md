## [Link to the Website](https://elicohenportfolio.onrender.com/home)

## Overview
This is a personal portfolio project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes a Home page, an About Me page, a projects page, and a Contact page. 

## Features
Home Page: This landing page for the website has a picture of me and links to the other pages.
About Me Page: Provides information about my background, skills, and interests.
Projects Page: Displays a list of all projects fetched from MongoDB.
Contact Page: Displays my contact information.
The website has a register and login feature, but I only use it to log in as the admin and add new projects I have completed. They use MongoDB to store user details.

## Tech Stack
MongoDB: Database to store project information.
Express: Web framework for Node.js to handle server-side logic.
React: Front-end library to build the user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
